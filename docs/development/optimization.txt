 [ ] generalize newTermName from `arrayChar` to CharSequence, use this from
     finishNamed and fullNameInternal to avoid intermediate strings, char arrays
 [ ] why does `Tree#symbol` show up so prominently in profiles? Can we route the common
     cases through a monomorphic call?
 [x] TailCalls takes 2%, half that time is in `failHere`, updating a hash map from Context => Position.
 [ ] @inline Transformer.atOwner, merge with SuperAccessors.atOwner
 [x] check inlining in Typers, etc.
       - important to benchmark after clean builds as inlining seems more reliable compiling from source
       - this might mean that we are missing inlining opportunities between scala-reflect / scala-compiler
         e.g. Type#orElse
 [x] We have a lot of inefficient convenience methods in Name/NameOps that convert Strings to names, e.g.
     `def startsWith(s: String) = startsWith(s: TermName)`. These are used by `isLocalDummyName`,
     `dropLocal`, `dropSetter`, `isLoopHeaderLabel`,
     [ ] do another sweep for residual inefficiencies
 [x] hoist needsFlatClasses checks in Scope creation
